Breakout #1: Designing Your Preference Schema

Activity: In small groups, design and implement a preference schema for your weather application.

Instructions:
    Review your current weather application features
    Identify all customizable aspects (units, display options, data settings, etc.)
    Create a preference schema similar to the example, but tailored to your app
    Implement a basic PreferenceManager class
    Test loading, saving, and validating preferences
    Prepare to share your schema design choices

Expected Output:
    A comprehensive preference schema dictionary
    A working PreferenceManager implementation
    Test code demonstrating preference operations
    Documentation of design decisions

Discussion Points:
    What preferences did you identify as most important?
    How did you organize your preference categories?
    What validation rules did you implement?
    How would you handle preference migration if the schema changes?
