Breakout #2: Implementing the Settings UI

Activity: In your groups, implement a settings dialog for your weather application.

Instructions:
    Create a SettingsDialog class based on the example
    Implement controls for at least 3 different preference types
    Add proper validation and error handling
    Test the dialog with your PreferenceManager
    Implement at least one custom control (color picker, font selector, etc.)
    Ensure changes are properly saved and can be cancelled

Expected Output:
    A working settings dialog with multiple tabs
    Proper preference controls for different data types
    Validation and error messages
    Integration with the PreferenceManager
    At least one custom preference control

Discussion Points:
    How did you organize your settings tabs?
    What validation challenges did you encounter?
    How do you handle preference dependencies?
    What custom controls did you create?
